                        In computational geometry, a convex hull is the smallest convex
                        polygon that contains a given set of points. It is a fundamental
                        concept with applications in various
                        fields such as computer graphics, robotics, and image processing. - GeeksForGeeks

                        This mini-project combines a
                         visualization of a neat algorithm -- the Graham Scan --
                        with some practice with CSS grids.

                            Click some dots on the canvas, then click start. You can choose to either step through each individual calculation
                            or animate the entire algorithm.
